# Swipe
This is a simple game made in Unity where player has to swipe in the direction shown within time limit.

# Features
The main objective of the game is to rotate the cube in the direction shown within the time limit. The reflexes of player are the main focus here.

# Installation
You can try out the game by downloading the apk from Releases tab of the repo.

# Controls
On Android there are simple touch controls which can be used to swipe in the direction you want the cube to rotate. On PC while developing, WASD keys can be used to rotate the cube.

# Current Progress
Currently the cube rotates correctly and Game Over screen pops up if correcat input is not given within time limit.

# TODO
- Implement better UI
- Merge direction prompt onto the cube itself
- Add different prompts like "Don't Turn", "Touch anywhere but Cube" etc
